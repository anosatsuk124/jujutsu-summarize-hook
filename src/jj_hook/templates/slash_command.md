Use the jj-commit-organizer sub-agent to analyze and organize the commit history appropriately.

Please review the commit history using jj log and jj diff, then logically organize it by grouping related commits and creating meaningful commit messages.

Specifically:
1. Check the current commit history with jj-commit-organizer
2. Identify commits to merge or changes to separate with jj-commit-organizer
3. Propose organization using jj squash and jj describe
4. Execute actual organization work after user confirmation with jj-commit-organizer

## Analysis Targets
- Consecutive small modifications to the same file
- Related features split across multiple commits
- Meaningless commit messages ("fix", "wip", "tmp", etc.)
- Separated typo fixes and formatting changes
- Logically unified changes dispersed across commits

## Organization Principles
- **Feature Units**: One feature or fix should be one commit
- **Logical Consistency**: Related changes should be integrated into the same commit
- **Clear Messages**: Each commit's purpose should be evident
- **Reviewability**: Changes should be appropriately sized for understanding

## Safety Guidelines
- Gradual organization (avoid massive changes at once)
- Don't touch pushed commits
- Always request confirmation before executing organization

You **must use `-m`** to specify commit messages if you do not specify `-m`, the terminal will **hung** until opening the editor because **you cannot use any editors**.

Without `-m`, **DO NOT execute** `squash` `commit` `describe` \!\!\!\!
